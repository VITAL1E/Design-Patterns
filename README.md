# Design-Patterns Project


## What ?

A simple console candy boutique app. Given the requirement that we have to use at least 4 design patterns for this project, our team had used 5 design patterns. These patterns include **Factory Pattern, Singleton, Builder, Null Object, Decorator.** Each of these patterns has been assigned a specific tasks of the program. 


## How ?

**Factory Pattern** was used for **Cake** class, therefore depending on the choice of the customer, the specific class will be instantiated.

**Singleton Pattern** can be used when there is only one product left. In this example, shop has only one **Snickers** (chocolate bar) left, so it is up to the customer to decide to buy or not.

**Builder Pattern** is responsible for Doughnut class. It has a **Builder** class that instantiates fields and use the **build** method to create the new object of that type.

**Null Object** was used to illustrate that there may be the chance that a product is not available anymore. In this project, **Soda** is used for this design pattern and if the costumer orders one, they will be told that it is not available anymore.

**Decorator Pattern** summarizes to the fact that there is an interface **Coffee** and we just have a simple class **CoffeeDecorator** that implements it and other coffee classes extend it to override methods.


## Why ?

The purpose of this laboratory was to learn design patterns and use them in a project. They are a must if one desires build complex software solutions. Team had fun working on this project.
